# Why Biological Data Feels Messier Than Your sock drawer (and How ETL Can Help)

Ever found yourself with a missing sock for any pair you are trying to find? We could sit and calculate the various probabilities of how we end up with a different sock everytime, but hey - it is a Monday morning and you have to rush. Now imagine your sock drawer is full of **millions of pieces of socks**, each labeled differently, some missing the matching pair, some folded into weird shapes. Welcome to the world of biological data.  

Researchers today are swimming in a sea of data — gene expression profiles, compound libraries, drug response profiles — but much of it is **inconsistent, incomplete, and scattered**. Trying to integrate these datasets without a plan is like trying to assemble IKEA furniture without instructions… in the dark.

## The Chaos Behind the Data

Here’s what makes biological datasets particularly tricky:  

### 1. Multiple Names for the Same Thing  
- Genes and compounds often have **three or four different IDs** by construction.  
- One dataset may use **GENCODE IDs**, another **Ensembl IDs**, and someone else just uses gene symbols.  
- One lab may use a scientific drug name (eg: Acetyl salicylic acid ), while another might use a market name, ie, aspirin.
- This can be observed in biological sample names as well such as immortalized patient cells aka cell lines. A simple name such as HeLa has seven synonyms on [Cellosaurus](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_0030) (HELA; Hela; He La; He-La; HeLa-CCL2; Henrietta Lacks cells; Helacyton gartleri).

You get the idea. Without a common language, merging datasets can introduce mistakes — like putting the wrong socks with your shoes.  

### 2. Missing Labels and Metadata  
- Imagine trying to cook a recipe without knowing whether a “cup” is metric or US — that’s what it’s like trying to analyze poorly annotated omics data, especially from different groups. 
- Often, files come with no information about how they were generated, what units were used, or which genome version they’re aligned to. Data generation has come a long way, but ask anyone who worked with data recently and they will nod their heads in approval that we need systematic ways of annotating.     

### 4. No Version Control  
- Some datasets are updated, modified, or manually curated, but there’s no record of what changed or when. For instance, you decided to update your dataset from 3 years ago and cannot find a set of genes in the latest update of your dataset. There is no trace of which GENCODE gene annotations you used back then, leaving you with a minimal information to backtrace and debug.  
- Reproducing past analyses becomes almost impossible — like trying to find that blue shirt you wore to a wedding two years ago.

## ETL to the Rescue

This is where **ETL pipelines** come in — they are basically the **Marie Kondo of data**. ETL stands for **Extract, Transform, Load**:

1. **Extract**  
   - Pull raw data from multiple sources: PubChem, ChEMBL, GENCODE, or your lab experiments.  

2. **Transform**  
   - Standardize identifiers (genes, transcripts, compounds).  
   - Clean up metadata and fill in missing pieces.  
   - Validate and remove duplicates.  

3. **Load**  
   - Deposit the curated, consistent data into a structured, queryable database (like BigQuery on GCP).  

Think of it as taking that messy closet, folding all the clothes properly, labeling everything consistently, and putting it into organized drawers. Once it’s done, finding the right shirt — or the right dataset — becomes trivial.

## Why It Matters

Without ETL and standardized annotations:  
- Integrating datasets is slow and error-prone.  
- Analyses are difficult to reproduce.  
- Scaling up to large datasets feels impossible.  

With ETL pipelines:  
- Your data is **clean, consistent, and queryable**.  
- You can **trust the results** of your analyses.  
- You free up time to focus on the **science**, not the housekeeping.

## The Takeaway

Messy, inconsistent data is a reality in biology — but it doesn’t have to hold you back. ETL pipelines bring order to the chaos, making your datasets **reproducible, scalable, and understandable**.  

In future posts, I’ll walk through a **step-by-step ETL workflow**, showing how to integrate PubChem, ChEMBL, and GENCODE data, with example scripts and practical tips.  

Stay tuned — it’s time to bring some order to our biological closets.
